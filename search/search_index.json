An AIP is a DANS-V0 bag , a SIP is a directory with a bag and a deposit.properties file. ARGUMENTS \u00b6 -d, --datasetId <arg> A single easy-dataset-id to be transformed. Use either this or the input-file argument -i, --input-file <arg> File containing a newline-separated list of easy-dataset-ids to be transformed. Use either this or the dataset-id argument -l, --log-file <arg> The name of the logfile in csv format. If not provided a file easy-fedora-to-bag-<timestamp>.csv will be created in the home-dir of the user. (default = /home/vagrant/easy-fedora-to-bag-2020-02-02T20:20:02.000Z.csv) -o, --output-dir <arg> Empty directory in which to stage the created IPs. It will be created if it doesn't exist. -f, --output-format <arg> Output format: AIP, SIP. 'SIP' is only implemented for simple, it creates the bags one directory level deeper. easy-bag-to-deposit completes these sips with deposit.properties -s, --strict If provided, the transformation will check whether the datasets adhere to the requirements of the chosen transformation. -h, --help Show help message -v, --version Show version of this program trailing arguments: transformation (required) The type of transformation used: simple, thematische-collectie. EXAMPLES \u00b6 $ easy-fedora-to-bag -d easy-dataset:1001 -o ~/stagedAIPs simple creates a directory in '~/stagedAIPs'. This directory is an AIP bag, it has the UUID as the directory name, and contains all relevant information from 'easy-dataset:1001' using the 'simple' transformation. $ easy-fedora-to-bag -d easy-dataset:1001 -s -o ~/stagedAIPs simple easy-dataset:1001 is transformed according to the simple transformation, but only if it fulfils the requirements. The AIP bag is generated in directory '~/stagedAIPs'. $ easy-fedora-to-bag -s -i dataset_ids.txt -o ./stagedAIPs -l ./outputLogfile.csv simple creates a bag in './stagedAIPs' for each dataset in 'dataset_ids.txt' using the 'simple' transformation. If a dataset does not adhere to the 'simple' requirements, or is not deposited by 'testDepositor', it will not be considered and an explanation will be recorded in 'outputLogfile.csv'. RESULTING FILES \u00b6 For every dataset in the output there is a bag-dir created in the <output-dir> . This bag-dir contains the transformed metadata and data in a DANS-Bagit-Profile AIP and is named with a UUID. Furthermore, a <log-file> is generated in csv format with the following headers: easy-dataset-id input easy-dataset-id UUID UUID created for the resulting AIP doi doi as it appears in the EMD depositor EASY-User-Account of the depositor of the dataset transformation transformation used comments if the dataset does not conform to the transformation-requirements, it is chronicled here TRANSFORMATIONS \u00b6 SIMPLE \u00b6 A simple transformation transforms the dataset, with no consideration of other datasets, 'thematische collecties' or external storage. With the option --strict the transformation will check that the input dataset conforms to the following requirements. The dataset has a DANS-DOI is PUBLISHED is REQUEST_PERMISSION or OPEN_ACCESS has no Jumpoff page (i.e. there is no dans-jumpoff object in Fedora with a isJumpoffPageFor relation to this dataset) has no replaces or isVersionOf relation that references a DANS-DOI, DANS-URN or easy-dataset-id is no thematische collectie (i.e. the title does not contain thematische collectie ) is not in the vault already (i.e. check in easy-bag-index ) INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION \u00b6 Currently this project is build only as an RPM package for RHEL7/CentOS7 and later. The RPM will install the binaries to /opt/dans.knaw.nl/easy-fedora-to-bag and the configuration files to /etc/opt/dans.knaw.nl/easy-fedora-to-bag . BUILDING FROM SOURCE \u00b6 Prerequisites: Java 8 or higher Maven 3.3.3 or higher RPM Steps: git clone https://github.com/DANS-KNAW/easy-fedora-to-bag.git cd easy-fedora-to-bag mvn clean install If the rpm executable is found at /usr/local/bin/rpm , the build profile that includes the RPM packaging will be activated. If rpm is available, but at a different path, then activate it by using Maven's -P switch: mvn -Pprm install .","title":"Manual"},{"location":"#easy-fedora-to-bag","text":"Retrieves a dataset from Fedora and transforms it to an AIP bag conforming to DANS-BagIt-Profile v0","title":"easy-fedora-to-bag"},{"location":"#synopsis","text":"easy-fedora-to-bag {-d <dataset-id> | -i <dataset-ids-file>} -o <staged-AIP-dir> [-s] [-l <log-file>] <transformation>","title":"SYNOPSIS"},{"location":"#description","text":"Tool for exporting datasets from Fedora and constructing Archival/Submission Information Packages.
